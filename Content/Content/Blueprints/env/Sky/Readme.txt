Thank you for downloading Gregdumb's time-of-day skydome blueprint, version 1.4!  Created with Unreal Engine 4.8 but tested up to 4.18.

You can use this work any way you want, commercial or not.  I won't sue you if you don't credit me, but it would be nice if you did.

Installation Instructions:

- Extract this archive;
- Copy the "Content" folder into your project folder (it should merge with the content folder already there);
- When it asks if you want to merge folders, say yes;
- Launch UnrealEd, and load the project you copied that folder to;
- Go to 'File > Open Level' and choose "TimeOfDayTemplate.umap" (it should be located under \YourProject\Content\Maps);
- Hit simulate, and watch the sun move!
